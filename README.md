<h1> Capstone Project: DropPoint </h1>
<h3> Made by: Brenda and Glenda Garcia </h3>

<h2> Project Purpose </h2>
	The project intends to plan, design, and create a mobile application that enhances user experience along the process of planning and managing a trip, be it locally or to different locations around the world. It can be a tedious process when looking for locations to visit when planning a trip, resulting in stress, and time lost researching various Internet sites for recommendations. With the “DropPoint” mobile application, users will have one platform with all the essentials needed for optimizing the search for places to visit, advice from travelers or natives to the country, and photographic opportunities. 
  
<h2> Project Description </h2>
	As travel fanatics, we understand the struggle, and hardships that come from planning a trip, therefore, we are proposing an application that can address this issue, and hopefully, increase user experience. The “DropPoint” application will provide a space where travelers can interact with one another through sharing, rating, and viewing external users’ recommendations. To start off, the application will provide a login/registration screen, for users to create their own account to be part of the “DropPoint” community. With a registered account, the user will be able to look for recommendations with two options: a map view, or a search engine which works through the use of tags and user entered data. The search engine will be more specific to what a user is looking for, while the map view will provide a map where different map pins are scattered pointing to the location where each photo was taken. Let’s say that you booked a trip to Mexico City, and are looking for recommendations of places to visit, photos to take, and best places to eat. In this case, through the map or search engine of the mobile application, you will be able to see what other users have shared from Mexico City, as well as read each individual post for recommendations on the best time to visit, money matters, clothing attire, among other things. Additionally, users will be able to rate the posts they like, as well as be redirected to the profile of the user to check out their publications. The “DropPoint” mobile application can provide users with valuable information, ideas, and tips to increase their travel experience and optimize the hours lost doing research through many external websites. With “DropPoint”, we recognize that it is time to search, get inspired, travel, and create new experiences!

<h2> Development, Roles, and Documentation </h2>
The project will be carried out using an Android mobile user interface (mobile UI). The application will be done using Android Studio, which is the official IDE for Android app development. The programming language that will be used in the app will be Java. We'll be utilizing SQLite as our database engine. This database was chosen since it is an in-memory open-source library that requires no configuration and no installation. It's also quite convenient because it's only 500kb in size, far less than other database management systems. Brenda Garcia will be working on the front-end user interface portion of the project as well as the design of it and the documentation of the project. Glenda Garcia will be in charge of the requirements, the testing portion, the database aspect of the project, including but not limited to creating the database, tables, and necessary connections. Both of us will be working on the development of the application and to ensure that the project goes according to plan we will be having weekly meetings to address what needs to be done and what is finished.

Google Maps is an application that inspired us to make this project in the sense that it is a useful app to plan a trip. Google Maps not only provides instructions for various modes of transportation, but it also provides recommendations regardless of location. Additionally, anybody may add photographs and reviews of areas they've visited. We would be applying that similar idea, but it won’t be a navigation app, instead users will be able to log in to search for the best spots and photo ideas. Another app that inspired us is Instagram in the sense that our app will also be a photo sharing platform. Like Instagram, users will be able to share photographs but instead of with their followers, it will be with everyone that uses the app. Users may also look at, rate, and post on “DropPoint”. Below, references to mobile applications and documentation that are similar to our project proposed.
